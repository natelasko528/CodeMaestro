# CodeMaestro DevKit — Generic Full-Stack App Build System

This folder is a **drop-in, agent-ready development kit**: a set of Markdown specs, prompts, and checklists that an AI coding agent can use to autonomously build a complete full-stack application.

## How to use (human)
1. Duplicate this folder into a new project repo under `/spec/` (recommended).
2. Fill in the blank templates (files prefixed with numbers).
3. Give the entire folder to your orchestrator agent (Opus 4.5 / Claude Code / Gemini CLI / Cursor Agent).
4. The orchestrator must follow: `00-START-HERE.md` + `13-DEFINITION-OF-DONE.md`.

## How to use (agent)
Read `00-START-HERE.md` and follow the workflow exactly.
